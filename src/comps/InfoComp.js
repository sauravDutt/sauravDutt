                “The function of good software is to make the complex 
                appear to be simple.” - Grady Booch. I am a self taught 
                web developer and a learner, I like to research about 
                latest tech, new frameworks and polish my skills. I have 
                an insatiable curiosity for AI – particularly deep 
                learning – applications and their potential to change 
                the technology landscape.
