                    A drone, in technological terms, is an unmanned aircraft. 
                    Drones are more formally known as unmanned aerial vehicles 
                    (UAVs) or unmanned aircraft systems (UASes). Essentially, 
                    a drone is a flying robot that can be remotely controlled 
                    or fly autonomously through software-controlled flight plans 
                    in their embedded systems, working in conjunction with onboard 
                    sensors and GPS.
