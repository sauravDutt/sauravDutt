A little about me !! - 
“The function of good software is to make the complex appear to be simple.” - Grady Booch. I am a self taught web developer and a learner, I like to research about latest tech, new frameworks and polish my skills. I have an insatiable curiosity for AI – particularly deep learning – applications and their potential to change the technology landscape.
